while it is true that significant aspects of methodology are speciric to the particulars of biology, with creative and substantial tweaks some surprising aspects of biological study can become the genetalizabile.
For instance, software for phylogenetic reconstruction is tailored to the four letter nucleotide alphabet and reconstruction is a problem specific to biology itself because in simulation we in principle have access to perfect information.
However, recent work has engineered analogs of reconstruction approwcjrs to achieve highly scalable phylogenetic tracking.
And the rest pf the bioinformstics infrastructure for measuring and intetpreting phylogenetic structure translates very cleanly.
