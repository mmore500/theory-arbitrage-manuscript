\section{Opportunities for Future Arbitrage} \label{sec:opportunities}

future work:
\begin{itemize}
  \item trait-based phylogenetic analysis
  \item spatial analyses (necessary due to parallel and distributed computing)
  \item sampling-based analyses (necessary due to parallel and distributed computing --- borrow from DOE grant)
  \item detecting speciation through population genetics methods \citep{sukumaran2021incorporating}
\end{itemize}
