possible titles:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Untapped Opportunities to Arbitrage Biological Theory for Genetic Programming (opinion)
  \item Arbitrage of Biological Theory, Methods, and Tools for Genetic Programming (review)
  \item Arbitrage of Theory, Methods, and Tools from Biology to Genetic Programming
\end{itemize}

possible theses:
\begin{itemize}
  \item in addition to taking inspiration from biological phenomena, we should also be more directly taking theory/methods/analyses from the literature
  \item the biological analogy continues to be useful/meaningful for genetic programming, as evidenced by recent and ongoing work mining the biological literature for methods and theory that benefit genetic programming
\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}

original inspiration for the field
\begin{itemize}
  \item koza, recombination and crossover
  \item island-based model
  \item diversity maintenance (EcoEA, Lexicase)
  \item speciation
\end{itemize}

criticism: \citep{moore2023evolution,woodward2009evolution}

classic work
\begin{itemize}
  \item coevolution (of tests and test case, ???)
  \item plasticity
  \item genotype-phenotype maps
        \begin{itemize}
          \item The arrival of the frequent: how bias in genotype-phenotype maps can steer populations to local optima.
          \item Genome growth and the evolution of the genotype-phenotype map
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

recent work
\begin{itemize}
  \item ecology assembly theory \citep{dolson2024reachability}
  \item phylogeny for prediction/analysis \citep{hernandez2022can,shahbandegan2022untangling}
  \item phylogeny-informed selection (like managing a nature reserve, taking into account phylogenetic history?)
  \item alife data standards: interoperation with bioinformatics infrastructure \citep{lalejini2019data,moreno2024apc}
\end{itemize}

future work:
\begin{itemize}
  \item trait-based phylogenetic analysis
  \item spatial structure (parallel and distributed computing)
  \item sampling-based anlayses (parallel and distributed computing)
  \item detecting speciation through population genetics methods \citep{sukumaran2021incorporating}
\end{itemize}

there's also a lot of potential for arbitrage in the opposite direction, through the question of evolvability \citep{kirschner1998evolvability}.
\citep{moreno2018understanding}

Of consequence to both fields: bootstrapping problem.
