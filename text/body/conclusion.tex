\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

The sophisticated capabilities of the natural world --- still, in many cases, profoundly unrivaled by artificial engineering --- strongly evidences the creative potential of evolutionary computation, and also lends it peculiar charisma.
% The notion of being seduced by this charisma is a reasonable criticism of evolutionary computation \citep{moore2023evolution,woodward2009evolution}.
The evolutionary metaphor in genetic algorithms and genetic programming has proven highly prodictive, through some combination of capturing inherent potential and, more simply, capturing research attention.
Despite reasonable criticisms of metaphor-driven algorithm development \citeo{moore2023evolution,sorensen2015metaheuristics}, there is compelling potential to strengthen the foundations of evolutionary computation by instead leaning further into the evolution metaphor and engaging the analytical methods and explanatory theoretical constructs developed in evolutionary biology and allied fields.

In this work, we have reviewed notable examples where reaching into the biological literature has shown potential to improve our visibility into application-oriented evolutionary computation.
Such research, much of it very recent, reflects first steps.
Important extensions remain to be fleshed out and connected to \textit{bona fide} real-world use cases.
Further, reviewed steps in only a small portion of potentially fruitful directions for arbitrage of theory and analysis from biology to evolutionary computation.
In our closing section, we have highlighted a few additonal possibilities.

Productive exchange between biology and evolutionary computation is a two-way street.
Already, digital organisms find use cases in experiments conducted in conjunction with \textit{in vivo} inquiry \citep{TODO}.
However, application-oriented genetic programming and genetic algorithms have special value to offer, we believe, in the realm of genotype-phenotype maps and evolvability.
Owing to its artificial nature, genotype-phenotype maps --- much less maps with good evolvabilty --- do not come baked into evolutionary computation \textit{a priori} \citep{kirschner1998evolvability}.
As such, evolutionary computation has invested significant effort into discerning how the properties of a genotype-phenotype map influence outcomes from adaptive evolution \citep{TODO}.
In particular, a promising line of work in evolutionary computation has sprung up in investigating how to harness unsupervised learning (e.g., autoencoders, LLMs) to generate evolvable genotype-phenotype maps \citep{moreno2018understanding,bradley2024openelm,wittenberg2023denoising,MORECITES}.
Corresponding work in biology, however, is only fledgling.
Indeed, work interpreting evolvability as an unsupervised learning process has been notably driven forward, in particular, in collaboration with evolutionary computation practicioners \citep{kouvaris2017evolution,szilagyi2020phenotypes}.

%TODO this needs a rewrite
The longstanding bidirectional exchange betwern evolutionary computation and evolutionary biology is truly remarkable, particularly in relation to other areas of AI/Ml where such efforts have arisen only more recently \citep{marblestone2016toward,richards2019deep}.
% synthesis of deep learning and neuroscience \citep{richards2019deep,marblestone2016toward}
%For instance, although deep learning is also rooted in a biological metaphor, there hasn't been as much fruitful impact translating neuroscience mechanisms to mainline research (although there have been efforts on certain frontiers CITE CITE CITE \citep{furber2014spinnaker}).
We look forward to seeing this exchange deepen and, in particular, benefit concrete objectives in better explaining how aspects of evolutionary computation work at a mechanistic level, in diagnosing failure cases, and prescribing appropriate methods for difficult domain problems.
